## This repo contians the software I wrote for the front page of Skynet MC, a private Minecraft community. 
###### Why is it open source one might ask?? Well, I like to keep all of my software work open source regardless of its purpose.

#

I am still actively developing this website along with the Minecraft server, Discord server, and other related softwares and services, some of which you can find on my GitHub!

This website uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
